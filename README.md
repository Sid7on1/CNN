# *****CNN*****
🧠 Standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for image classification tasks such as CIFAR-10 or MNIST.

📌 Architecture Overview

The CNN follows a classic design pattern suitable for beginner to intermediate deep learning tasks:
	•	Conv Layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
	•	MaxPooling: 2x2 kernel
	•	Conv Layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
	•	MaxPooling: 2x2 kernel
	•	Fully Connected Layer: 128 units, ReLU activation
	•	Output Layer: 10-class softmax output

🏗️ Features
	•	Built using PyTorch
	•	Works with CIFAR-10, MNIST, and similar datasets
	•	Modular and extensible for experimentation
	•	Can serve as a base model for transfer learning or advanced regularization techniques
